# ApartScraper
Generic Scraper looking for apartments sending e-mails

## Motivation One: Are you (desperatly) looking for an apartment?

Many apartment seekers in urban areas throughout the world are having trouble 
of organizing their search activities: 

1. There are many web-sites providing interesing offers. The market is in a state of continous flux.
2. Time is crucial! Some offers may disappear within hours.
3. It is a teadious work to re-enter your search-forms all the time.
4. It is a teadious filtering-activity to sort out lame duck offers that would consume even more time if you would mistakenly consider them.

## Motivation Two: The ApartScraper website

The founder of this project (me: Andreas Brey) will offer a website as a **CROWD-SERVICE**, purely financed through donations:

## Motivation Three: Who wants to hack a professional scraper?

There is no software in the AI-business that does not rely on structured bulk data from the internet / web. 
This **Github Open Source Project** should transfer knowledge of how to create working AI-solutions.
The specific ApartScraper context is: 

1. Learning Python, Git, HTML, CSS and some fancy extra-knwo how 'on the fly'.
2. Getting accustomed to IT project management techniques in software design.
3. Comparing Python based frameworks like BeautifulSoup, Selenium or Scrapy.
